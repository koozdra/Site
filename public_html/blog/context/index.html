    <h1>Multi-Armed Bandits</h1>
    <h2>Contextual Bandits</h2>

    <p>
      <a href="/blog/context/index.html">Part four - Contextual Bandits</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      We have four experiences and are operating in all provinces and territories. It may be the 
      case that there are some variants that work better for certain regions. If we test in a certain
      region the sample sizes are small, it's hard to know how long to run the experiments. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Contextual bandits allow us to segment an audience and run an experiment per context.
      A context is a description of a situation. A context is made up of one or more variables that 
      describe that situation. For example the format {province}-{region} takes on values such as AB-rural.
      For the national case all contexts are described as canada. Which means all pulls and rewards are accumulated
      in one context. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In our example we will be testing four user experiences across Canada. Our data set is going to be a set
      of conversion rates per province broken down by rural and urban. Generally we would run an experiment across
      all of Canada while ignoring that there is variance in conversion between provinces and rural vs urban users.
    </p>

    <h2>National View</h2>
    <p>
      The national view represents the conversion rates if we didn't take into account
      the context when selecting variants. Notice how homogenous the conversion rates
      are. It is not clear which one is best. This would be a result of typical A/B test.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that A/B test we collected the data and were able to segment the conversions by geographical
      location of the user. This view segments the audience into 20 categories. The best variant according to this 
      view is often not the best in the context. 
      For example, QC - rural, v3 has a conversion of 0.53 whereas v2 has conversion 
      of 0.88 which is much higher.
    </p>
    <div id="variantAveragesTableContainer"></div>

    <h2>Conversion Rates Per Context</h2>
    <p>
      The data set is a 20x4 array of conversion rates. 13 for provinces and territories
      and 2 for the region types. Conversions range from 0.5 to 0.9. Each conversion
      rate is calculated independently.
    </p>
    <div id="variantTableContainer"></div>

    

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      We are going to have a map keyed by a context name that is composed of a province name and region.
      This gives us a unique set of variant conversions from the conversions table. Pulls and rewards are 
      stored in the values of the map for each variant. This means that each context gets it's own experiment.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>National View Conversions</h2>
      <p>
        This is how the variant conversions evolve over time. Both algorithms are good at approximating
        the variant conversion rates.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Contextual vs National View</h2>
      <p>
        We can visualize the accumulation of regret. In this case regret is calculated
        as the difference in conversion rate of the best variant in a context and 
        the conversion rate of the variant selected.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the national case, even if the system picks the best variant, that variant
        is not the best variant in that context.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
        Cumulative Regret Over Time National vs Contextual By Algorithm
      </h3>
      <p>
        Using the contextual approach we see smaller regret accumulation than the 
        national approach. This mean we are using the best converting variant
        more often because of contextual information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the short term contextual e-greedy looks really good. In the long
        run contextual UCB starts to outperform contextual e-greedy. In this example
        this happens around half a million iterations.

        Cumulative Reward

    <div class="section">
      <h2>System Performance</h2>
      <p>
        If we had this dataset when we were making decisions, each time we had to choose a variant for a context, we
        would find the best converting variant and use it. If we did that we can calculate the average of the 
        best conversions across all of our contexts. This gives <strong>0.79</strong>. This is the best we can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we relied on traditional A/B testing we would productize V3 with a conversion rate of <strong>0.70</strong>.
        This represents the baseline of a single variant with any optimization.
      </p>

      <h3>  
        Conversion Over Time
      </h3>
      <p>
        Show how the conversion changes by algorithm and context description.
      </p>
      <p>
        The national conversions are below the baseline. This is because some exploration is required which costs
        some conversion. From the national perspective we can't do better than the best converting variant which 
        is 0.70. In the contextual case e-greedy outperforms UCB in the short term. UCB will approach the optimal
        line and e-greedy will be parallel to it in the long run.

      <h2>The Value Of a Variant</h2>
      <p>
        For variant iteration we need to identify which variants should be removed. For each context
        we will have one of two situations; the variant we are considering is the current best or
        it is not. If we remove the best variant in a context, then the second best variant would be used.
        For contexts where the variant is not the winner it wouldn't affect the experiment if
        it was removed. In the best variant scenario the difference in conversion between
        the best and second best variants can be summed across contexts to find relative contribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each variant we take the contextual conversion rates and set the variants conversion
        to zero. Then find the best possible average conversion rate across contexts.
      </p>

      <h3>  
        Best Achievable Conversion Rate - Single Variant
      </h3>

      <p>
        The results show that removing any one of the variants would result in a lose in possibly
        achievable conversion rate. <strong>V1</strong> is the most important. Without it, our maximum
        achievable conversion drops by the most when removed.
      </p>

      <h3>  
        Best Achievable Conversion Rate - Multiple Variants
      </h3>

      <p>
        The results show that removing more than one of the variants would also result in a lose in possibly
        achievable conversion rate. The loss is greater with this number of variants removed.
        Only two variant removal is explored here because removing three variants is just the 
        column average (national view). Removing four variants
        doesn't make sense.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Our example looked at a problem at two different levels of granularity. By segmenting the
        audience we found that different experiences convert differently in different regions.
        By running an experiment per context using contextual multi-armed bandits, we were able to gain conversion
        and come close to the optimally achievable conversion rate. The longer the horizon the better decisions
        this system will make. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally the conversion rate of the best performing algorithm, contextual e-greedy (at least in the short
        term), reaches a 
        conversion rate of 0.75 to 0.77. Which is a 7 to 10 percent uplift.
