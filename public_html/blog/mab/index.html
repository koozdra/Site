    <h1>Multi-Armed Bandits</h1>
    <h2>
      Optimal decision making in the face of uncertainty.
    </h2>

      <a href="/blog/mab/index.html">Part one - The Casino</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/blog/regret/index.html">Part two - Regret</a>

      <a href="/blog/dynenv/index.html">Part three - Dynamic Environments</a>
    </p> 
    <p>
      Multi-Armed bandits are named after "one armed bandits" a nickname for slot
      machines that implies that they are stealing your money. A slot machine has
      an <strong>arm</strong>. Players <strong>pull</strong> the arm to play. If they
      win they get a <strong>reward</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The multi-armed bandit imagines a row of slot machines that have different
      chances of winning. How should the slot machines be chosen as we play to maximize
      our profit?  
    </p>

    <p>
      As we select variants we are going to keep two counters per variant. 
      <strong>Pulls</strong>: The number of times we have used this variant.
      <strong>Rewards</strong>: The number of times something good happened for this variant.
      These counters for each variant comprises our <strong>model</strong>. Each variant 
      has a <strong>conversion rate</strong> which is the number of rewards we have
      per number of pulls. We will
      use the model to make decisions and we will update our model based on outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we select variants we want to balance two goals; <strong>Exploitation</strong> - using
      the best variant as much as possible and <strong>Exploration</strong> - using the other variants
      in order to learn about them and confirm the best one is indeed the best one or to find another
      best variant.
    </p>

    <h2>The Casino</h2>
    <p>
      There are four slot machines to choose from <strong>V0, V1, V2 and V3</strong>. 
      They each have a chance of winning <strong>[10%, 30%, 70%, 90%]</strong>.
      We have <strong>1000 opportunities</strong> to choose a slot machines (horizon).
      We start with $1000.
      It costs <strong>$1 to use a slot machine</strong>. If we win, we get $2 dollars, if we loose, we
      loose the dollar.
    </p>
    <img src="/blog/images/mab.png"></img>
    <p>
      Not only do we want to use V3 as much as possible, we also have a secondary goal
      to avoid using V0 as much as possible. We will have to use the worst variant because
      we have to learn about all the variants.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three decision strategies presented. Each is evaluated on the problem
      and the result dollar value is shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      The charts visualize the distribution of the cumulative sum of variant usage over the test period.
      All the simulations run in the browser in a worker.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Random</h2>
      <p>Our most naive solution could be to completely ignore our model and randomly select the variants. </p>
      <h3>Variant Selection Over Time</h3>
      <p>
        Variants are selected uniformly. As we have more trials the size of each bucket
        for each variant approaches the same size.
      </p>

      <h3>Variant Selection Distribution</h3>
      <p>Buckets are roughly equally sized.</p>
      <div>
        <canvas id="decision_distribution_random" width="400" height="400" class="centered"></canvas>
      </div>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Total: $<strong><span id="total_random"></span></strong></p>
      <p>
        This is a random walk around the expected average across all of the variants. 
        We should end up roughly where we started at $1000.
      </p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Epsilon Greedy</h2>
      <p>
        Let's split our time between our two goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>90% - Exploitation - Use the best variant</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10% - Exploration - Pick a random variant</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Variant Selection Over Time</h3>
      <p>
        Rapid convergence on the best variant with consistent exploration.

      <h3>Variant Selection Distribution</h3>
      <p>
        Heavy utilization of the best variant.

        <canvas id="decision_distribution_e_greedy" width="400" height="400" class="centered"></canvas>
      </div>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Total: $<strong><span id="total_e_greedy"></span></strong></p>
      <p>
        We used the best variant more than half of the time. In our exploration we used
        V0 as much as V1 and V2.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>UCB - Upper Confidence Bound</h2>
      <p>
        In this selection strategy we use the conversion rate of the variant and a boost
        to variants that fall below an uncertainty threshold. This selection strategy
        is deterministic (doesn't depend on randomness).

      <h3>Variant Selection Distribution</h3>
      <div>
        Best variant is used and worst variant avoided most of the time.
      </div>
      <div>
        <canvas id="decision_distribution_ucb" width="400" height="400" class="centered"></canvas>
      </div>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Total: $<strong><span id="total_ucb"></span></strong></p>
      <p>
        Our dollar figure is the highest. We used the best variant for the vast amount of our decisions.
        We only minimally used our worst variant.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Conversion Rate Over Time</h2>
      <p>
        The model is counters for variants. The conversion rate is a measure of how often
        a reward is experience per pull. The model uses these conversion rate to make 
        decisions about which variant to choose next. This chart visualizes how
        these conversion rates evolve over time.
      </p>
      <div>
        <canvas id="conversion_over_time" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
      </div>
      <p>
        UCB tends to undervalue lower performing variants. The conversion rate of the best
        variant is most accurate since it used at most or more in all three selection 
        strategies.
      </p>

    <h2>100 Simulations Aggregations</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>
        Dollar Averages
      </h3>
      <p>
        We can run the simulations and keep an average per algorithm. There are three lines
        per selection strategy. The top and bottom lines are the max and min seen so far.
        The middle line is the running average.
      </p>
      <div>
        <canvas id="simulation_averages" width="400" height="200"></canvas>
      </div>
      <p>
        We see that the random selection strategy stays near $1000. E-greedy average is slightly higher
        than UCB. This is explained in part 2 and has to do with our limited number of trials. The band around
        UCB is much tighter than e-greedy.
